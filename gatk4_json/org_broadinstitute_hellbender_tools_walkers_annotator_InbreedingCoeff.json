  "description": "Likelihood-based test for the consanguinuity among samples\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis annotation estimates whether there is evidence of consanguinuity in a population. The higher the score, the\n higher the chance that some samples are related. If samples are known to be related, a pedigree file can be provided so\n that the calculation is only performed on founders and offspring are excluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eStatistical notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe calculation is a continuous generalization of the Hardy-Weinberg test for disequilibrium that works well with limited coverage per sample. The output is a Phred-scaled p-value derived from running the HW test for disequilibrium with PL values.
